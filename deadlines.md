## Formative

Interim report
As discussed in our meeting today. Excellent on the whole. There are a few points which will require closer attention in the final report, such as providing references for concepts or results which are not common knowledge in the intended readership. We will send you annotated copies flagging other issues, mostly minor, by the end of the month.
