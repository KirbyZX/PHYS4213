## Presentation

- Face audience instead of screen when speaking
- Include a few more details of results on slides
- Include error bars when show observational data
- Explain any annotations/labels on images
- Fill whitespace but leave enough space between lines
- Explain notation
"only cover three topics in a presentation with increasing complexity as you go along"

### Proforma
- facing the audience and avoiding over-reliance on notes?
- good use of the slides and other visual aids, keep to time?
- slides easy to read, figures legible?

### Practice feedback

- Ensure there is a PHYSICS focus, rather than MUSIC
    - Application of physics, why is it an interesting problem to solve?
    - Why are we solving this problem at all?
    - Why is quantum annealing necessary?

- Work on link between arrangement and AQC
    - Give some transition when introducing the concept

- Distinguish AQC from QA
    - AQC is universal, absolutely adiabatic, guaranteed ground state
    - "Adiabatic theorem"
    - Impossible to move slowly enough in practice so move to QA, relax adiabaticity
    - Rate of change determined heuristically, state might change
    - Remove materials science reference

- Ising model vs QUBO
    - $\sigma^z$ are NOT qubits, only spin operators
    - Switch between models using simple change of variable
    - Initial state (ground state of $H_0$) chosen as is easy to prepare
    - QUBO is difficult to solve analytically, so map to $H_p$ in order to solve
    - Show the MIS QUBO

- How are results found?
    - Run on D-Wave quantum hardware
    - True quantum annealer
    - Not just theoretical, THIS HAS BEEN DONE

- Explain graph theory more thoroughly
    - Introduce the idea of a graph earlier

- Highlight notes in score better

- Mention small literature review
    - Quantum computer music
    - AQC for music production, so why not arrangement?
    - Overview of current classical methods
    - This is a novel adaptation of the method, UNIQUE IDEA

- Include full references as footnotes
