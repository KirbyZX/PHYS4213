### Practice feedback

- Ensure there is a PHYSICS focus, rather than MUSIC
    - Application of physics, why is it an interesting problem to solve?
    - Why are we solving this problem at all?
    - Why is quantum annealing necessary?

- Work on link between arrangement and AQC
    - Give some transition when introducing the concept

- Distinguish AQC from QA
    - AQC is universal, absolutely adiabatic, guaranteed ground state
    - "Adiabatic theorem"
    - Impossible to move slowly enough in practice so move to QA, relax adiabaticity
    - Rate of change determined heuristically, state might change
    - Remove materials science reference

- Ising model vs QUBO
    - $\sigma^z$ are NOT qubits, only spin operators
    - Switch between models using simple change of variable
    - Initial state (ground state of $H_0$) chosen as is easy to prepare
    - QUBO is difficult to solve analytically, so map to $H_p$ in order to solve
    - Show the MIS QUBO

- How are results found?
    - Run on D-Wave quantum hardware
    - True quantum annealer
    - Not just theoretical, THIS HAS BEEN DONE

- Explain graph theory more thoroughly
    - Introduce the idea of a graph earlier
    - Point out nodes, edges etc.

- Highlight notes in score better
    - Draw boxes

- Mention small literature review
    - Quantum computer music
    - AQC for music production, so why not arrangement?
    - Overview of current classical methods
    - This is a novel adaptation of the method, UNIQUE IDEA

- Include full references as footnotes

## Report

https://thomas.deselaers.de/computing/texsqueezing.html

- Make it clear this is a physics project (as discussed in person already), in terms of detail given to descriptions of different components etc. 
- If you are including figures, it is imperative that each figure is directly referenced in text and a relevant description to help the reader understand your intended take away points included. This was not always the case in your report.  
- It was not immediately clear why we should use quantum for this problem. Ways to address this would be to discuss the reasons for a potential quantum advantage in the theory section but also to focus on the existence or lack thereof of an actual advantage in the discussions. 
- Several places are missing an adequate reference.
