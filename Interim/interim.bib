	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We provide Ising formulations for many NP-complete and NP-hard problems, including all of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. This collects and extends mappings to the Ising model from partitioning, covering, and satisfiability. In each case, the required number of spins is at most cubic in the size of the problem. This work may be useful in designing adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Score reduction is a process that arranges music for a target instrument by reducing original music. In this study we present a music arrangement framework that uses score reduction to automatically arrange music for a target instrument. The original music is first analyzed to determine the type of arrangement element of each section, then the phrases are identified and each is assigned a utility according to its type of arrangement element. For a set of utility-assigned phrases, we transform the music arrangement into an optimization problem and propose a phrase selection algorithm. The music is arranged by selecting appropriate phrases satisfying the playability constraints of a target instrument. Using the proposed framework, we implement a music arrangement system for the piano. An approach similar to Turing test is used to evaluate the quality of the music arranged by our system. The experiment results show that our system is able to create viable music for the piano.},

	abstract = {We present a statistical-modeling method for piano reduction, i.e.Â converting an ensemble score into piano scores, that can control performance difficulty. While previous studies have focused on describing the condition for playable piano scores, it depends on player's skill and can change continuously with the tempo. We thus computationally quantify performance difficulty as well as musical fidelity to the original score, and formulate the problem as optimization of musical fidelity under constraints on difficulty values. First, performance difficulty measures are developed by means of probabilistic generative models for piano scores and the relation to the rate of performance errors is studied. Second, to describe musical fidelity, we construct a probabilistic model integrating a prior piano-score model and a model representing how ensemble scores are likely to be edited. An iterative optimization algorithm for piano reduction is developed based on statistical inference of the model. We confirm the effect of the iterative procedure; we find that subjective difficulty and musical fidelity monotonically increase with controlled difficulty values; and we show that incorporating sequential dependence of pitches and fingering motion in the piano-score model improves the quality of reduction scores in high-difficulty cases.},

	abstract = {Modern keyboards allow a musician to play multiple instruments at the same time by assigning zones -- fixed pitch ranges of the keyboard -- to different instruments. In this paper, we aim to further extend this idea and examine the feasibility of automatic instrumentation -- dynamically assigning instruments to notes in solo music during performance. In addition to the online, real-time-capable setting for performative use cases, automatic instrumentation can also find applications in assistive composing tools in an offline setting. Due to the lack of paired data of original solo music and their full arrangements, we approach automatic instrumentation by learning to separate parts (e.g., voices, instruments and tracks) from their mixture in symbolic multitrack music, assuming that the mixture is to be played on a keyboard. We frame the task of part separation as a sequential multi-class classification problem and adopt machine learning to map sequences of notes into sequences of part labels. To examine the effectiveness of our proposed models, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation over four diverse datasets of different genres and ensembles -- Bach chorales, string quartets, game music and pop music. Our experiments show that the proposed models outperform various baselines. We also demonstrate the potential for our proposed models to produce alternative convincing instrumentations for an existing arrangement by separating its mixture into parts.

	abstract = {This paper describes a music arrangement method of popular music that can convert a band score into a piano score with a steplessly-specified level of performance difficulty. The basic strategy of band-to-piano score arrangement is to select notes from an augmented band score obtained by up- and down-shifting the notes of an original band score by one octave. Given band scores and the corresponding piano scores with elementary- and advanced-levels, one can train a deep neural network (DNN) that estimates note masks conditioned by the difficulty levels. Conditioned by an intermediate level at runtime, however, the DNN tends to generate an advanced-level score. To solve this problem, assuming that an easier piano score is a subset of harder one, we estimate the basic importance of each note with a difficulty-agnostic DNN and then warp it with a power function depending on a specified difficulty level. To achieve the fine controllability of the difficulty level, we propose a training method that subjects the DNN to generating piano scores with various intermediate levels, where the note-level loss for those scores is evaluated using only the ground-truth elementary- and advanced-level scores. Considering the non-uniqueness of piano arrangement, the statistic-level loss with respect to the note density and polyphony level is also computed according to the given levels. The experimental results showed that the proposed method attained both the performance gain and the stepless difficulty control.},
